The palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry and notes of baking spice alongside assertive tannins.   \n",
       "13                                       This bold, earthy wine opens with aromas that suggest underbrush, meat juices, tobacco, cooking spices and woodland berries. The palate shows red and black cherries layered with notes of black pepper, toast and a hint of tobacco alongside assertive, brooding tannins. Drink 2015–2022.   \n",

       "15                                      Some occasions call for a wine that shows the highest levels of quality but also has a touch of friendliness or informality that makes it more approachable. Barolo Vigneto Arborina is such a wine. It offers elegant Nebbiolo tones of red fruit and blue flower with oaky spice and smoke.   \n",

Ruby-colored and medium-bodied, this Chianti offers informal aromas of wild berry, almond and cola backed by crisp acidity that makes it that much more appropriate as a companion to easy dishes.   \n",

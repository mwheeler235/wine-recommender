       "0                                         Earthy aromas of white mushroom and dried roses that are characteristic of Tuscan Sangiovese are what you notice first here. The wine then segues to fruit and spice aromas, although those berry notes are on the mature and jammy side. Fresh acidity and firm tannins suggest a pairing with red meat.   \n",
       "1                                              Earthy aromas suggesting grilled porcini, leather, tilled soil and balsam lead the nose. The dense, chewy palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry, licorice and dried sage flavors, set against a tannic backdrop that needs time to soften. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink 2022–2032.   \n",

       "3                 Scorched earth, game, cured meat and leather waft out of the glass. The taught palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate roasted coffee bean, anise and a vanilla note but not quite enough fruit richness. Tightly wound, grainy tannins leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.   \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                       Inky and dark, this has modern touches of toasted oak and exotic spice. Those smoky aromas will decrease with time, giving prominence to the cherry and blackberry flavors already present.   \n",

The rustic but juicy palate doles out black cherry, spicy blueberry and ground pepper framed by hearty tannins.   \n",
       "6                             Here's an earthy wine that opens with aromas of scorched earth, leather, truffle, raspberry compote and a note of cured meat. The chewy palate offers mature Morello cherry, grilled herb, coffee, clove and anise while firm, ripe tannins provide the framework. A tobacco note closes the finish. Drink 2018–2028.   \n",

The mouthfeel is lean and bright.   \n",
       "8                          This robust red opens with scorched earth, new leather, underbrush and dark spice aromas. The palate is brawny and monolithic, offering licorice, dried cherry and clove flavors with the warmth of evident alcohol. It's framed by chewy tannins and should be drunk soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.   \n",

The palate offers up ripe black cherry, white pepper and the warmth of evident alcohol. It also has massive, astringent tannins. Drink after 2019.   \n",
       "10                                                                                  Here's a Best Buy white wine that would pair with salads, vegetable dishes and appetizers. It's crisp and luminous with lively aromas of citrus, lemon zest, stone fruit and melon. Pecorino is one of Italy's hottest varieties on the indigenous grape scene.   \n",
       "11  Definitely not Zinfandel-like, despite its Primitivo origins; a rather nondescript wine, as a matter of fact. Light cherry overtones are noted on the nose and palate. The tannins are mouth-drying. This is certainly not a good example of how far Puglia has come with this grape. However, it would work fine with a slice or two of pizza.   \n",

It closes on an aniseed note.   \n",
       "13                                                    This straightforward, inviting Barolo boasts classic Nebbiolo aromas of rose, leather, berry spice and tilled earth. It's not loaded with complexity, but the sour cherry, black pepper and clove flavors are delicious. It closes on a note of subtle oak alongside a drying, tannic finish.   \n",
       "14                                                                                                                                           This earthy wine features aromas of truffle, ripe plum, leather and just a whiff of barnyard.

It shows an informal, compact disposition in the mouth.   \n",
       "16                                                     This bold, earthy wine opens with aromas that suggest underbrush, meat juices, tobacco, cooking spices and woodland berries. The palate shows red and black cherries layered with notes of black pepper, toast and a hint of tobacco alongside assertive, brooding tannins. Drink 2015–2022.   \n",
       "17                                                                                                          This crisp white wine from Etna offers a bright, luminous hay color and fragrant aromas of green fruit, citrus and white peach. The mouthfeel is creamy but not heavy or thick and those characteristic mineral tones render it unique.   \n",
       "18                                                            If you're looking for a bright, easy wine to pair with pasta or pizza, this is it. Ruby-colored and medium-bodied, this Chianti offers informal aromas of wild berry, almond and cola backed by crisp acidity that makes it that much more appropriate as a companion to easy dishes.   \n",
       "19                                                                                        This warm climate Primitivo opens with subtle tones of dried herb and light spice that give it a very Mediterranean feel. But there's also a touch of warm rubber that distracts from the overall picture. The high alcohol adds extra heat on the close.   \n",

The mouthfeel is creamy but not heavy or thick and those characteristic mineral tones render it unique.   \n",

It's crisp and luminous with lively aromas of citrus, lemon zest, stone fruit and melon. Pecorino is one of Italy's hottest varieties on the indigenous grape scene.   \n",
       "11  Definitely not Zinfandel-like, despite its Primitivo origins; a rather nondescript wine, as a matter of fact. Light cherry overtones are noted on the nose and palate. The tannins are mouth-drying. This is certainly not a good example of how far Puglia has come with this grape. However, it would work fine with a slice or two of pizza.   \n",
